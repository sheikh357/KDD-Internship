# Data Exploration and Preparation
### Quality of Data Cleaning
The PubMed Summarization dataset was loaded from Hugging Face, and the first 100 samples were selected for both the document and section levels. Data cleaning involved removing extra spaces and special characters, and converting the text to lowercase.

### Thoroughness of Preprocessing
Preprocessing steps included:

Removing extra spaces
Removing special characters
Converting text to lowercase

Preprocessing was applied consistently across the dataset to ensure uniformity and readiness for summarization.
